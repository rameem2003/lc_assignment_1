            <h1>Early life and career</h1>
            <hr>

            <p>Mohammed Aamir Hussain Khan was born on 14 March 1965 in Bombay to Tahir Hussain, a film producer, and Zeenat Hussain. Several of his relatives were members of the Hindi film industry, including his late paternal uncle, producer-director Nasir Hussain. Outside the movie industry, he is also related to Abul Kalam Azad through his grandmother. Khan is the eldest of four siblings; <b><u>he has a brother—Faisal Khan—and two sisters, Farhat and Nikhat Khan. His nephew, Imran Khan, is a contemporary Hindi film actor</u></b>. Khan is also the second cousin of six-time MLA, former BJP vice president and current Governor of Manipur Najma Heptulla, who is the grand-niece of Abul Kalam Azad. As a child actor, Khan appeared on screen in two minor roles. <i><b>At the age of eight, he appeared in Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973), which was the first masala film in Bollywood</b></i>. The following year, he portrayed the younger version of Mahendra Sandhu's character in Madhosh. Khan attended J.B. Petit School for his pre-primary education, later switching to St. Anne's High School, Bandra, until the eighth grade, and completed his ninth and tenth grades at Bombay Scottish School, Mahim.[34] He played tennis in state level championships and became a state-level champion. He professed he was "much more into sports than studies". Khan completed his twelfth grade at Mumbai's Narsee Monjee College, and described his childhood as "tough" due to the financial problems his father had, as his film productions were mostly unsuccessful. Khan said, "There would be at least 30 calls a day from creditors calling for their money," and that he was always at risk of being expelled from school for non-payment of fees.</p>

            <p>In addition to assisting Hussain, Khan acted in documentaries directed by the students of the Film and Television Institute of India. Director Ketan Mehta noticed Khan in those films, and offered him a role in the low-budget experimental film Holi. Featuring an ensemble cast of newcomers, Holi was based on a play by Mahesh Elkunchwar, and dealt with the practice of ragging in India. The New York Times said that the film was "melodramatic" but "very decently and exuberantly performed by the nonprofessional actors". Khan played a rowdy college student, an "insignificant" role that was described by CNN-IBN as "lack in finesse"</p>
